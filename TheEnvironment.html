<p>As you can see the water usage required to feed the animals in the animal agriculture industry are staggering. There is also a staggering amount of this water that is returned to the system as toxic animal waste, that then pollutes clean water sources</P>

<p>One of the saddest facts related to animal agriculture is that we have 700mn people on the earth starving for food everyday. Yet 70% off all the grain we grow, goes to feeding animals to get big really fast to meet profits. These un-natural growth habits then lead to making us as humans more un-healthy</p>
