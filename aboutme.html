<p>My name is Jesse, I grew up on Mount Desert Island in Maine. I graduated from the University of Maine Orono in 2007. I studied Horticulture and minored in Business. After college I spent three years managing a organic farm in the summer and a woods crew in the winter, managing 1400 acres of forest and carriage roads. I then went to work with my Uncle and family and for 5 years I traveled the country (48 states) and built Coach Inc. stores. This was a great experience as it allowed me to work with family and see the country. Meeting people from all sorts fo backgrounds and beliefs has always been a passion of mine. On top of working, traveling and learning I started to take my health seriously. I was always in what I thought was good physical shape, I played basketball 3-4x a week. Little did I know I had a lot further to go and the potential locked up inside me to do better. I went from going out in whatever city I was currently in for the nightlife, to finding a local gym or trainer to sweat and workout with. <br /> Growing up in Maine I spent a lot of time eating meat, seafood, poultry and wild game. What came along with my physical health journey was the basic knowledge that it all started with "ones"" diet and I needed to make drastic improvements. For the next 6-7 months I had stopped eating red meat and pork. I was consuming more veggies and fruit, but still eating fish and chicken. I knew about the vegan diet, but just kinda of ignored it. <br /> It wasn't unitl I started dating a women who lived in Malibu and had been a vegan for 3 years, that I started to open my eyes. After a couple weeks of learning from her the benefits of the Plant-based diet and consulting with my dietician, I was convinced it was for me. I havent eaten a animal in almost 3.5 years now and at 34 years of age I feel the best I have ever felt. Both physically and spiritually.<p/>
